Project Overview:
Our project is an A.I. Sales Data Analyst that establishes a Point of Sale (P.O.S.) software that stores transactional data and tracks inventory. 
The A.I. substitutes the role of a data sales analyst creating reports, suggesting recommended approaches based on data stored, tracks products rate of sales, and profit margins. 
If the A.I. notices the sales of a particular product A are very high; while another product B is struggling, it will recommend possible changes and alternatives. 

Project Build Outline:
Platform: We are planning to implement the project as a web application using React for the frontend and Django for the backend

IDE: Our team will work in VSCode, its extensions, collaboration tools, and cross-platform support make it a strong candidate for team-based development.

Backend: We have looked into PostgreSQL as our primary database option since it offers the reliability and structure needed for transactional and inventory data while supporting scalability for larger datasets.

Libraries: For data visualization and A.I., we are considering Chart.js to create graphical reports and scikit-learn for implementing analytical models. 

APIs: Potential transactional integrations such as the Stripe API for payment processing and a barcode/QR scanning API for inventory management.

Package Manager: We anticipate using npm for managing frontend dependencies and pip for Python libraries on the backend.
