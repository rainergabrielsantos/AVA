Project Overview:
Our project is an A.I. Sales Data Analyst that establishes a Point of Sale (P.O.S.) software that stores transactional data and tracks inventory. 
The A.I. substitutes the role of a data sales analyst creating reports, suggesting recommended approaches based on data stored, tracks products rate of sales, and profit margins. 
If the A.I. notices the sales of a particular product A are very high; while another product B is struggling, it will recommend possible changes and alternatives.
